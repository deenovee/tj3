Forex Trading Journal Web App

Overview

This Python Flask server project is designed to serve a web-based Forex trading journal. The project utilizes Flask Blueprints to organize routes into modular components, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. The web application allows users to sign in or register, view their trading account balance, and monitor their trading success based on various parameters such as day, time, and asset. Users can keep track of their daily earnings and conveniently insert their trades using a CSV file downloaded from MetaTrader.
